## Scope of Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for the overall health and quality of this project.  
Their key responsibilities include:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests  
- Ensuring that documentation remains clear, consistent, and aligned with OS2’s principles  
- Encouraging contributions and supporting new contributors  
- Coordinating releases or updates when relevant  
- Escalating strategic or governance-related decisions to the Board, management or other relevant bodies  

Maintainers act as stewards of the project — ensuring it remains open, transparent, and true to its purpose.


## Collaboration and Workflow

Maintainers work collaboratively using **GitHub Issues** and **Pull Requests**.  
All significant changes should:

- Be linked to an open issue  
- Receive at least one review from another maintainer or contributor before merging  
- Be described clearly in commit messages and pull request titles  

When multiple maintainers are active, they share responsibilities for reviews, merges, and release coordination.


## Becoming a Maintainer

To become a maintainer of this project, you should demonstrate:

- **Sustained engagement** — consistent participation through issues, discussions, or pull requests  
- **Good judgment** — alignment with OS2’s open, transparent, and collaborative values  
- **Constructive communication** — helping others improve their contributions  

Once ready, request maintainer status by opening an issue or contacting an existing maintainer.


## Removal or Transition Process

Maintainers may be moved to *emeritus* status under the following circumstances:

- Extended inactivity (e.g., 6 months or more)  
- Repeated lack of response to issues or pull requests  
- Personal request to step down  

Changes to maintainer status are made through open discussion and consensus among current maintainers.
